# ars-electronica-facade
The Ars Electronica Center/Museum in Linz, Austria has an interactive LED light display facade that can be coded in Processing. We made a bouncing box that lights up the entire wall when it perfectly aligns with a corner. Here are all the iterations of the project, created over the course of 2 days.
